# XSS-Vulnerability

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is the most common vulnerability in web applications. XSS attacks allow an attacker to control the victim’s browser with a vulnerable web application. 
The absence of user input sanitisation makes it possible for an attacker to insert and run malicious scripts.

In the case of Stored XSS attacks, an application which receives user input and stores the data without proper validation or sanitization. As a consequence, 
the malicious data will appear to be part of the site and run within the user’s browser under the privileges of the web application

## POC:

To exploit stored XSS vulnerability, attackers inject script into the user input fields.
For example, submitting the payload  <script>alert(1)</script> in the user input field (update profile)  and saving the data.




Application does not properly sanitize or validate the input, this script could be executed in the user's browser, leading to an XSS attack.





Making sure that all user input is adequately sanitized is the best defense against XSS attacks.
